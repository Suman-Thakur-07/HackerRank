Objective
In this challenge, we practice reading input from stdin and printing output to stdout.

In C++, you can read a single whitespace-separated token of input using cin, and print output to stdout using cout. For example, let's say we declare the following variables:

string s;
int n;
and we want to use cin to read the input "High 5" from stdin. We can do this with the following code:

cin >> s >> n;
This reads the first word ("High") from stdin and saves it as string , then reads the second word ("") from stdin and saves it as integer . If we want to print these values to stdout, separated by a space, we write the following code:

cout << s << " " << n << endl;
This code prints the contents of string , a single space (), then the integer . We end our line of output with a newline using endl. This results in the following output:

High 5
Task
Read  numbers from stdin and print their sum to stdout.

Input Format

One line that contains  space-separated integers: , , and .

Constraints

Output Format

Print the sum of the three numbers on a single line.

int main() {
    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */ 
    int a, b,c;
    cin>>a>>b>>c;
    cout<<a+b+c;
      
    return 0;
}
